use pip install statsmodels to install most frequently used models required 

a. Contents of the code.ipynb file include:
Problem 1 Part a through c
Problem 2 various parts in sequential blocks of codes with comments
Problem 3: Since I'm not sure if this question means a combination of ARMA or just AR and MA separately, I'm doing a AR and MA separate calculation (just AR or just MA), and then also doing a calculation that contains all possible cases i.e. nested loop with all combinations of p and q. So I have two similar blocks of codes serving different purposes but still, the conclusion is the same by coincidence.
