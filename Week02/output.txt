Conclusion:
We fail to reject null hypothesis and conclude that the difference is not significant and thus package is unbiased for mean calculation
We reject null hypothesis and conclude that the difference is significant and thus package is biased for variance calculation
We fail to reject null hypothesis and conclude that the difference is not significant and thus package is unbiased for skewness calculation
We reject null hypothesis and conclude that the difference is significant and thus package is biased for kurtosis calculation
